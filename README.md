ABSTRACT
==
The number of women delivering at advanced maternal age (AMA; >=35) continuously increasing in developed and high‚Äêincome countries. Large cohort studies have associated AMA with a significantly increased risk of various pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes, which also raises great concerns about the adverse effect of AMA on the long-term health of the offspring. Specific acquired characteristics of parents can be passed on to descendants through certain molecular mechanisms, yet the underlying connection between AMA-related alterations in parents and offspring remains largely uncharted. Here, by profiling the DNA methylomes and transcriptomes of paired parental peripheral blood and cord blood samples from nuclear families, we revealed that AMA would induce a series of aging-like changes in the DNA methylome and gene expression in both parents and offspring. The expression changes in several genes, such as SLC28A3, were highly relevant to the disorder in DNA methylation. In addition, AMA-related differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified in the mother and offspring groups showed remarkable similarities in both genomic locations and biological functions, mainly involving neuron differentiation, metabolism, and histone modification pathways. The AMA-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) shared by mother and offspring groups were highly enriched in the processes of immune cell activation and mitotic nuclear division. We further uncovered the developmental-dependent dynamics for the DNA methylation pattern of those intergenerationally correlated DMRs during pre-implantation embryonic development, as well as the diverse gene expression patterns during gametogenesis and early embryonic development for those common AMA-related DEGs presenting intergenerational correlation, such as CD24. Moreover, some intergenerational DEGs, typified by HTRA3, also showed the same significant alterations in AMA MII oocyte or blastocyst. Our results revealed the potential intergenerational inheritance of both DNA methylome and transcriptome changes associated with AMA and provided new insights relevant to understanding health problems in AMA offspring.
